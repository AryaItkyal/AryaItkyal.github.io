<h2>End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition based on Hybrid CTC/Attention mechanism</h2>
<p>Last Updated: 5th May</p>
<p>Reimplemented the paper <a target="_blank" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8068205">Hybrid CTC/Attention Architecture for End-to-End Speech Recognition</a> in pure python and PyTorch. Earlier implementation existed on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/espnet/espnet">ESPNET</a> but the pre-processing step uses Kaldi which is written in C++. Also the pipeline seemed complicated for people looking for just training and implementing the ASR. The code is available on github.</p>

<h2>Five Little Chicks</h2>
<p>Last Updated: 26th April</p>
<p>It was just like any other morning, me and other chicks- A, C, D and E were sitting quietly with fear in a spherical rusted cage, looking at a crow sitting on the railing of the balcony. It was our third morning in the cage. The cage was actually made for big flying birds like a dove. We were small enough to get outside, but wouldn’t dare to as the crow was sitting and staring on our heads all the time. We all had five bowls for each and had been served enough food for the first week.
 
Like every other group, our group had a bully/boaster – ‘A’ who was indeed the strongest amongst us all and would look down upon others. Then there was a loner— ‘C’ who was quite happy being in a cage as he had company all day. And then there were these twins-- ‘D’ and ‘E’ who were very weak but had each other back every time and would most of the time bitch about somebody in some corner. But the cage had no corners so even if anybody whispers it is technically heard by all.
 
The next week, the person who was our food provider—the giant, gave food only in four bowls and not the fifth one. That was a bit strange at first, and I was busy thinking what made him do that whilst the others were busy complaining with their high pitch voice only attracting more crows to the cage. Nevertheless, we all shared the food for this week, and were waiting for the next week’s food. But now as the third week commenced, our giant came and refilled only three of the bowls. Now as there wasn’t enough food for all of us, the situation inside became very tense. All were angrily clucking around loudly, but to no avail. And on the other hand, ‘A’ said that he will be eating an entire bowl himself and doesn’t care about the others. We were startled but nobody stood up—the twins as usual started whispering in each other's ears, the loner doesn’t care about anything until he has company and I was wondering what to do. A theory just crossed my mind that the food will be reduced every week, equivalent to one chick's diet. And if this continues we will starve and die and ‘A’ will be the only one at the end. So for a second opinion, I conversed with ‘C’ but everybody heard it.
 
For 2 seconds nobody said a word and everybody was staring at me, then ‘A’ laughed and said that in the end he will live over our flesh. In a flash, the other three charged over ‘A’ and started pushing him out of the cage. The three were yelling out to me for help saying that it was either ‘A’ or us! Choose! I accompanied them and we were able to push him out of the cage. To be specific push him in a crow’s belly. The air was now filled with a sense of victory and guilt. But it seemed that this wasn’t over, me pointing out the cycle of reduction of food made everybody- specifically the twins to think about the future food and secure it for them. But as always, as the twins were planning whom to push out next, we both heard it. As there is no turning back like once a rubber is stretched beyond its elastic limit it won't return to its original shape, so without any hesitation I went up to ‘C’ and told him that they are planning to push one of us and I wouldn’t want to take a chance who that would be, would you? I propose that we attack them by surprise before they approach any one of us and push them outside. Agreeing to this fact, ‘C’ readily agreed and we both charged over the twins and pushed them out. This time there was no guilt but only a sense of victory. It was all set, ‘C’ was happy, I was ‘happy’ and we had enough food for the next three weeks.
 
x: This is nothing less than the truth we will have to face in the near future. Putting aside the possibility of finding another planet for human habitat, the story relates the world as a cage and us as the prisoners or in this case chicks. Our ever-increasing population exponentially consuming the natural resources will divide people into colonies and force us to fight for survival. And believe me in our case both the sides will lose—the losing side will lose lives whereas the winning side will lose humanity, emotions, etc. the very things that make us human.

<h2>Diabetic Retinopathy Lesion Segmentation</h2>
<p>Last Updated: 26th April</p>
<p>Due to the advances in Medical science it has become possible to detect Diabetic Retinopathy at an early stage. But due to unavailability of the humongous number of doctors required for reliable diagnosis, and the increasing number of Diabetes affected people, there is a high requirement for automation. We tried to approach the challenge of automating the segmentation of different type of lesions like Microaneurysms, Haemorrhage, Soft and Hard Exudates using a new novel architecture of Fusion Net.</p>

<h2>Pixel-Link Text Detection</h2>
<p>Last Updated: 26th April</p>
<p>Traditional Text-Detection methods have focused on bounding box regression to detect text in real images. This inherently has many problems like curved text, aspect-ratio sensitivity of regression models, density of predictions and so on. Pixel-Link treats text-detection as a pixel level instance segmentation problem with each pixel being clubbed to its neighbouring pixel if joined by a "link" which is also predicted by the model. For more in-depth analysis you can read the paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01315.pdf">Link to Paper</a>. I reimplemented Pixel-Link on github.</p>

<h2>Ping - Pong</h2>
<p>Last Updated: 26th April</p>
<p>I thought of implementing the basics of reinforcement learning and convolutional neural networks for training a neural network to predict the movement of the bat to reflect back the ball. I implemented the entire graphical interface using basic python and numpy array and the code for the same has been uploaded on git-hub for reference. </p>

<h2>Image Stitching</h2>
<p>Last Updated: 26th April</p>
<p>The task was to stitch a heavily blurred frames of a video to get the entire image of the tissue because the microscope can only see a limited part of it at a time. The project is really challenging in the aspect that there is some random noise, some smudge on the lens of the microscope, the image is heavily blurred and also the brightness has been autoadjusted in input. A challenging but a fruitfull process for applying the things I have learnt in signals and systems.</p>

<h2>RSA key encryption</h2>
<p>Last Updated: 26th April</p>
<p>
						Wouldn't it be ideal if nobody stole anything in this world nor had any malicious intent? Well we do not live in such an idealized world. So to Save my projects from all those trying to steal it, I made an RSA file encryption program. The basics are simple, the implementation not so.
</p>
<p> How it works??</p>
<p>
					   So suppose Cooper wants to send a message to Murph from some other Galaxy. But there are some aliens trying to intercept this message. So first Cooper tells Murph, "Hey I want to send a message to you". Then Murph sends a public key to Cooper. But these aliens in between also intercept this key. They are like "Haha, whatever you send will be recieved by us. Even if you send a way to change code, we will understand it" Obviously Cooper does not know whether the key has been seen by the aliens or not. He used the public key and encodes the entire message and sends it to Murph. And alas the aliens get the message. But wait, it is gibberish. And even though they are giving it their all, they can't seem to use the public key to decode the message.
</p>
<p>
					   The message goes to Murph and Murph too recieves some gibberish message. Now how will she decode this message?? Well she has an advantage over the aliens. She has a private key which enables her to decode the message easily. This is how any encryption works in principle.<br>
